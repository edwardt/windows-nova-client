SYNOPSIS
    fvertest [-v version] [-q] [d:][path]filename.ext

AVAILABILITY
    Win32 - Windows 95, 98, Me, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 2008, etc.

DESCRIPTION
    FVerTest is a short utility designed to help IT professionals with checking
    file versions for scripting purposes.

    FVerTest tests the file version for a Windows executable file, such as an
    .EXE or .DLL file, that contains version information. It can report a
    file's version and it can also compare it to a specified version.

PARAMETERS
    -v  Specifies that you want to compare the file's version with the version
        number specified after the -v. Specify version numbers as a.b.c.d,
        where a = major version, b = minor version, c = release, and d = build.
        For example, -v 11.0.7.03.32. If you omit any values after the major
        version, FVerTest assumes zeros (e.g. 11 = 11.0.0.0).

    -q  Tells FVerTest to run silently (no output).

    Note that the file's name must appear after the -v and -q parameters on the
    command line.

EXIT STATUS
    0   The file's version is > the version specified after the -v parameter.

    1   The file's version = the version specified after the -v parameter.

    2   The file's version is < the version specified after the -v parameter.

    3   An invalid version number was specified on the command line.

    4   The file was compiled without version information, or one of the calls
        to the Windows APIs failed.

    5   File not found.

EXAMPLES
    1.  fvertest c:\windows\system\vbscript.dll

        This command will report the version number of the specified file; e.g.

        [5.7.0.5730] c:\windows\system\vbscript.dll

    2.  fvertest -v 5.7 c:\windows\system32\vbscript.dll

        This command will return an exit code of 0 if the file's version is
        greater than 5.7.0.0, 1 if the file's version is exactly 5.7.0.0, or 2
        if the file's version is less than 5.7.0.0. The output appears as
        follows:

        File's version [5.7.0.5730] > specified version [5.7.0.0]

    3.  fvertest -v 5.7.0.4 -q c:\windows\system32\jscript.dll

        This command will return an exit code of 0 if the file's version is
        greater than 5.7.0.4, 1 if the file's version is exactly 5.7.0.4, or 2
        if the file's version is less than 5.7.0.4. The command will run
        silently.
