SYNOPSIS
    ostest [-p 9x | NT] [-g] [-v version] [-s servicepack]
      [-b build] [-h yes | no] [-r workstation | server | DC | notworkstation]
      [-t none | remotedesktop | appserver] [-a x86 | amd64 | x64 | ia64]

AVAILABILITY
    Win32 - Windows 95, 98, Me, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 2008, etc.

DESCRIPTION
    Without command-line options, OSTest displays information about the current
    operating system in the following format:

    Platform: ...
    Version: ...
    Service Pack: ...
    Build: ...
    Home edition: ...
    Role: ...
    Terminal Server: ...
    Architecture: ...

    Operating system support is as follows:

    * Windows 9x/Me only supports Platform and Version
    * NT 4.0 prior to SP6 only supports Platform, Version, and Service Pack
    * NT 4.0 SP6 and later supports all details

    OSTest only queries the current computer; it cannot query a remote
    computer.

PARAMETERS
    -p 9x | NT
        Tests if the current OS platform is Windows 9x/Me or Windows NT.

    -g  Specifies that the numeric tests that follow on the command line are
        "greater than or equal to" instead of "equal to." This affects -v, -b,
        and -s.

    -v version
        Tests the OS version number, in x.y format (e.g., 5.1).

    -s servicepack
        Tests the OS service pack number (0 = no service pack, 1 = SP1, etc.).

    -b build
        Tests the OS build number (e.g., 7600).

    -h yes | no
        Tests whether the current operating system is a "home" edition (e.g.,
        Windows 7 Home Basic, Windows 7 Home Premium).

    -r workstation | server | DC | notworkstation
        Tests the operating system's role (workstation, member server, or
        domain controller). 'notworkstation' means the operating system is
        not a workstation (i.e., it's a member server or domain controller).

    -t none | remotedesktop | appserver
        Checks whether the current machine supports Terminal Server (RDP)
        connections, and in which mode (remote desktop or application server).

    -a x86 | amd64 | x64 | ia64
        Checks whether the current machine's processor architecture is x86,
        AMD64 (same as x64), or IA64. Note that "-a amd64" and "-a x64" are
        identical.

    Other than -g, command-line options may appear in any order. If you want to
    use -g, then it must appear before any numeric tests.

    If you specify one or more command-line options, OSTest executes silently
    and returns an exit code (see EXIT STATUS, below).

    Note that Windows 9x/Me only supports -p and -v, and Windows NT 4.0 prior
    to SP6 only supports -p, -v, and -s. Windows NT 4.0 SP6 and later supports
    all options.

EXIT STATUS
    OSTest returns an exit code of 1 if all parameters match the current
    operating system, or 0 if one or more parameters do not match the current
    OS. Any other exit code is a Windows API error.

NOTES -- WINDOWS 95, WINDOWS 98, AND WINDOWS MILLENNIUM EDITION
    Windows 9x/Me only support -p and -v. To test for 9x/Me, use -p 9x and the
    version numbers below:

    4.0  Windows 95
    4.1  Windows 98 or Windows 98 SE
    4.9  Windows Millennium Edition

    OSTest does not distinguish between Windows 98 and Windows 98 SE.

NOTES -- WINDOWS NT 4.0
    OSTest only supports -p, -v, and -s for Windows NT 4.0 prior to SP6. NT 4.0
    SP6 and later supports all of the options.

NOTES -- WINDOWS NT 4.0 SP6 AND LATER
    OSTest uses a Windows API structure, OSVERSIONINFOEX, to test version
    information. Windows versions (as of this writing) are as follows:

    4.0  Windows NT 4.0
    5.0  Windows 2000
    5.1  Windows XP
    5.2  Windows Server 2003
    6.0  Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008
    6.1  Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2

    Processor architecture is determined from the PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432
    environment variable. The PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432 variable is defined when
    a 64-bit system is executing a 32-bit process and contains the actual
    processor architecture.

    If the PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432 environment variable is not defined, the
    processor architecture is determined from the PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE
    environment variable.

EXAMPLES
    1.  Below is a logon script, Logon.bat, that uses OSTest to perform an
        appropriate launch command for the logon script.

        @echo off
        %0\..\ostest -p 9x
        if errorlevel 1 goto :WIN9X

        :WINNT
        start %SystemRoot%\system32\wscript.exe %0\..\Logon.js
        goto :EOF

        :WIN9X
        %windir%\COMMAND\START.EXE %windir%\WSCRIPT.EXE %0\..\Logon.js

        The above script tests for Windows 9x/Me. If the current operating
        system is running Windows 9x/Me (i.e, the OSTest exit code is 1), then
        the script executes Logon.js using the WScript host using the
        9x-specific START.EXE utility. Otherwise, the code under the WINNT
        label executes.

        This is one way to use OSTest to run a logon script using the WScript
        host.

    2.  ostest -p NT -v 5.1 -s 2

        The above command will return an exit code of 1 if the current
        operating system is exactly Windows XP SP2.

    3.  ostest -r workstation

        The above command will return an exit code of 1 if the current
        operating system is a workstation. Note that this command will return
        an exit code of zero if run on Windows 9x/Me (Windows 9x/Me only
        supports -p and -v).

    4.  ostest -t remotedesktop

        The above command will return an exit code of 1 if the current
        operating system supports remote desktop connections, but is not a full
        terminal server application server.

    5.  ostest -p NT -g -v 4.0

        The above command will return an exit code of 1 if the current
        operating system is at least Windows NT 4.0. The -g option makes -v
        mean "greater than or equal to 4.0."

    6.  ostest -p 9x -g -v 4.1

        The above command will return an exit code of 1 if the current
        operating system is Windows 98 (version 4.1) or Windows Me (4.9).

    7.  ostest -p NT -v 5.2 -t appserver

        The above command will return an exit code of 1 if the current computer
        is a Windows Server 2003 Terminal Server application server.

    8.  ostest -p NT -g -v 5.1 -r workstation -h no

        The above command will return an exit code of 1 if the current computer
        is running a non-home edition workstation version of Windows XP or
        later.

    9.  ostest -p NT -v 6.1 -r notworkstation

        The above command will return an exit code of 1 if the current computer
        is running Windows Server 2008 R2.

    10. ostest -p NT -v 6.1 -r workstation

        The above command will return an exit code of 1 if the current computer
        is running any flavor of Windows 7.

    11. ostest -p NT -g -v 5.1 -r workstation -a x64

        The above command will return an exit code of 1 if the current computer
        is running an x64 version of Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7,
        or later.
