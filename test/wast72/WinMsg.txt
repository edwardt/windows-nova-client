SYNOPSIS
    winmsg -t title [-m message | -f filename] [-c flags] [-w timeout]

AVAILABILITY
    Win32 - Windows 95, 98, Me, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 2008, etc.

DESCRIPTION
    WinMsg displays a dialog box on the screen with the specified message and
    title. You can also specify a set of flags that can be used to modify the
    appearance and behavior for the box. It will return an exit code
    corresponding to which button was pushed.

PARAMETERS
    -t  Specifies the title of the dialog box. Enclose it in quotes if it
        contains spaces or tabs.

    -m  Specifies the text for the dialog box. Enclose it in quotes if it
        contains spaces or tabs. This parameter also supports the following
        character sequences:

        \n  New line separator
        \t  Tab character
        \\  Literal '\' character

        For example, -m "Line 1.\nLine 2." Will appear in the dialog box as:

            Line 1
            Line 2

    -f  Uses the contents of the specified file as the dialog's text. The file
        should be a plain text file no larger than 32,767 bytes. (This
        limitation should not be an issue, since a file that large most likely
        will not fit in the dialog box anyway.)

    -c  A comma-separated list of flags that determines the appearance and
        behavior for the message box. The list of flags is listed below.

        OKCancel, AbortRetryIgnore, YesNoCancel, YesNo, RetryCancel
        - These flags specify what buttons the dialog box should display

        Error, Question, Exclamation, Information
        - These flags specify which icon the dialog box should display

        DefButton2, DefButton3
        - These flags specify the default button for the dialog box

        SystemModal
        - This flag causes the dialog to appear on top of all other windows

        The flags are not case-sensitive.

    -w  Specifies a timeout period in seconds (from 1 to 87.00, or a day). If
        no dialog buttons are pressed within the specified timeout period,
        WinMsg will close with an exit code of 8.

    You cannot specify both -m and -f. If you specify both, WinMsg will use
    whichever was specified first on the command line.

EXIT STATUS
    WinMsg will return an exit code that corresponds to the button that was
    used to dismiss the dialog box, as follows:

    OK = 1
    Cancel = 2
    Abort = 3
    Retry = 4
    Ignore = 5
    Yes = 6
    No = 7

    If you specified a timeout period and it elapsed, WinMsg will return an
    exit code of 8.

    If you use -f, there are several conditions that will cause WinMsg to
    display an error dialog box:

    *   WinMsg can't find the file
    *   You have insufficient permissions to access the file
    *   File is empty
    *   File is too large (> 32,767 bytes)

    If any of these conditions are true, WinMsg will display an error dialog
    and return an exit code of 9.

EXAMPLES
    1. winmsg -t Error -m "Script cannot continue." -c Error,SystemModal

       This command will display a message box contaning the title "Error," the
       message "Script cannot continue." The message box will appear with an
       Error icon and will appear on top of all other windows. The exit code
       will be 1 since there's only a single OK button.

    2. winmsg -t Confirm -m "Are you sure?" -c YesNo,Question

       The dialog will appear with Yes and No buttons, and a Question icon. The
       exit code will be either 6 or 7.

    3. winmsg -t "Legal Notice" -f \\DC1\NETLOGON\NOTICE.TXT
         -c OKCancel,Exclamation,SystemModal

       The dialog box contents are read from the specified file. The dialog
       will have OK and Cancel buttons, an Exclamation icon, and will appear on
       top of all other windows.

    4. winmsg -t "Logon Complete" -m Groups:\nGroup1\nGroup2\Group3
         -c Information -w 30

       This will display an informational dialog with an OK button that will
       remain on the screen for 30 seconds. If the user clicks OK, WinMsg will
       return an exit code of 1; if the timeout period expires, the exit code
       will be 8.
