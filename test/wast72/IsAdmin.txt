SYNOPSIS
    isadmin [-q]

AVAILABILITY
    Win32 - Windows 95, 98, Me, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 2008, etc.

DESCRIPTION
    IsAdmin checks if the currently logged-on user is a member of the
    computer's local Administrators group. It can also detect if the current
    user is a member of Administrators but the group is not enabled.

PARAMETERS
    -q  Run quietly (no screen output).

EXIT STATUS
    0   Current user is not a member of Administrators.

    1   Current user is a member of Administrators, or you are running IsAdmin
        on the Windows 9x/Me platform.

    2   Current user is a member of Administrators, but the Administrators
        group is not enabled. This is the condition when an administrator logs
        onto Windows Vista or later and User Account Control (UAC) is enabled.

EXAMPLES
    isadmin -q
    if errorlevel 2 goto :NEED_ELEVATION
    if errorlevel 1 goto :ADMIN

    With these three lines in a shell script, it will branch to the label
    :NEED_ELEVATION if the current user is a member of Administrators but UAC
    is active, and it will branch to the label if the currently logged on user
    is a member of Administrators.
