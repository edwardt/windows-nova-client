SYNOPSIS
    rasconns [-q] [-l] [-c connectionname]

AVAILABILITY
    Win32 - Windows 95, 98, Me, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 2008, etc.

DESCRIPTION
    RASConns was designed primarily for use in network logon scripts to detect
    if a user is connected to the network via a RAS connection (e.g. dial-up or
    VPN). It can return an exit code equal to the number of current open RAS
    connections, and it can also determine if a named RAS connection is
    currently active.

PARAMETERS
    -q  Run quietly (no screen output).
    -l  List each active RAS connection.
    -c  Specifies a connection name.

EXIT STATUS
    0
        No RAS connections active, or RAS is not installed.

    1
        With -c: The specified RAS connection is active.

    > 0
        Without -c: The number of RAS connections currently active (1 or more).

    If RASConns encounters a Windows API error, it will display one of the
    following error messages:

    *   LoadLibrary failed for rasapi32.dll - RAS not installed
    *   GetProcAddress failed for RasEnumConnectionsA - RAS not installed

    If RASConns encounters either of the above errors, it will exit with an
    exit code of 0.

    If you specify -c and a connection name, RASConns will return an exit code
    of 1 if the specified connection name is active, or 0 if it is not active.

EXAMPLES
    1. RASConns -q
       if errorlevel 1 goto :BYE

       These two lines in a shell script will cause the script to exit
       (provided the line :BYE is the last line of the file) if a RAS
       connection is active.

    2. RASConns -q -c "Company VPN"
       if errorlevel 1 goto :VPN

       This script example will branch to the label :VPN if the RAS connection
       named Company VPN is currently active.

    3. RASConns -l

       This command will list the currently active RAS connections; it will
       list one connection per line; for example:

       MyISP Dialup Connection
       Company VPN
