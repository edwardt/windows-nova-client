Windows Admin Script Tools
(C) 2001-2011 by Bill Stewart (bstewart@iname.com)

Version History

Version 7.2 (2011 Feb 24)

*   Fixed bug in OSTest -b argument -- it was doing a "greater than" test 
    instead of an "equals" test.

*   Added -a argument to OSTest to detect processor architecture.

*   Added 'notworkstation' parameter to OSTest's -r argument. You can use this
    to detect if the current OS is not a workstation (i.e., it's a member 
    server or a domain controller).

Version 7.1 (2010 Mar 18)

*   Updated license agreement -- no more bundling of these tools without
    permission.

*   I no longer use UPX compression on the executables as this has a tendency
    to get executables flagged as suspicious and/or malware.

*   IsMember.exe now uses an exit code of 0 for 'unsupported operating system'
    instead of 255, as it is possible for a user to be a member of 255 groups.

*   Corrected version numbers in the History.txt file.

Version 7.0 (2009 Jun 15)

*   FVER.EXE's file comparison algorithm, which formerly used a single
    floating-point number, did not work as expected; e.g., it would misreport
    version 6.9 as being less than version 6.12. (Thanks to Michael Klement for
    the report.) As a result, FVER.EXE has been replaced with FVerTest.exe that
    uses full version numbers instead. Note that the command-line syntax and
    exit codes are different than FVER.EXE. In particular, note that -f is not
    used, -v must be specified before the filename on the command line, and -q
    is required to make FVerTest run quietly.

*   ISAdmin.exe can now detect when a user is a member of Administrators, but
    the Administrators group is not enabled; this is the case when UAC is
    active on Windows Vista and later. (Thanks to Michael Klement for the
    suggestion and some implementation details.)

*   Compiled with Free Pascal 2.2.2.

Version 6.5 (2007 May 24)

*   Replaced OSVER and OSVEREX with OSTEST.

*   Corrected memory leak in RASCONNS.

*   Corrected potential buffer overflow in WINMSG.

*   Compiled with Free Pascal 2.0.4.

Version 6.4 (2007 May 17)

*   Private test version only.

Version 6.3 (2005 August 25)

*   NEEDBOOT's -l option had a bug (or rather, it displayed incomplete
    information) on the NT platform (NT, 2000, XP, etc.). Now, it displays a
    complete, and translated, listing of the contents of the
    PendingFileRenameOperations registry value.

Version 6.2 (2004 October 27)

*   Added OSVEREX utility.

*   OSVER used older terminology when referring to Terminal Server "remote
    administration mode." Updated this to the new lingo: "Remote Desktop."

Version 6.1 (2004 February 27)

*   Added -w timeout feature to WINMSG. Changed -f problem exit code to 9, and
    the timeout exit code is 8.

*   Added -l (list entries) feature to NEEDBOOT.

*   Added sample script LICENSE.BAT to the distribution to demonstrate simple
    cross-platform shell script programming using OSVER and WINMSG.

Version 6.0 (2004 February 13)

*   OSVER can now detect if the current machine is a Terminal Server running in
    either remote administration or application server mode. Also, -r returns
    99 instead of 0 if the NT platform was not detected or if OSVER failed to
    determine the system's role.

*   RASCONNS can now list active RAS connections, and it can also check if a
    particular connection is currently connected.

*   WINMSG can now display a customized dialog box and returns which button was
    pressed by the user. The dialog box text can also be read from a file.

Version 5.5 (2004 January 28)

*   Added NEEDBOOT.

*   Fixed minor bug in OSVER that might have caused a memory leak under some
    conditions.

Version 5.0 (2004 January 26)

*   Corrected subtle bug in isadmin.exe, that seemed to cause it to fail if a
    computer was a workgroup rather than a domain member. The new method is
    also slightly faster.

*   Added ISMEMBER.

*   Adjusted the Windows version resources in the executables to report correct
    translation information.

*   Found and corrected two other (minor) memory leaks.

*   Tools now compiled with FPC 1.0.10.

Version 4.1 (2003 December 15)

*   Corrected a memory leak bug in ISADMIN. Also, now it won't complain if you
    specify an invalid command-line parameter.

*   Added FAQ file.

Version 4 (2003 December 11)

*   Added ISADMIN.

*   Corrected typos for FVER (-r instead of -t now).

*   Changed icon in WINMSG error dialog to "critical error" instead of
    "exclamation."

Version 3 (2003 June 19)

*   Renamed FILEVER to FVER to avoid confusion with the Microsoft tool of the
    same name.

*   Updated OSVER to detect Windows Server 2003 (Windows NT 5.2).

*   Updated code in OSVER that reads the service pack level. It should now
    detect the service pack more reliably.

*   No other code changes. Only updated the documentation and the sign-on
    banners when the programs run, as well as their version information.

Version 2 (2002 January 18)

*   Initial version.
