SYNOPSIS
    ismember -l
    ismember [-v] groupname [...]

AVAILABILITY
    Win32 on Windows NT 4.0 or later (2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 2008, etc.)

DESCRIPTION
    IsMember checks if the currently logged-on user is a member of one or more
    groups.

PARAMETERS
    -l
        Lists the currently logged on user's group memberships.

    -v
        Outputs each match when found.

    groupname
        Specifies the name of the group to check. You can specify multiple
        groups. Group names should be prefixed by the security authority, and a
        "\" character. Some security authorities:

        BUILTIN\
            Specifies a built-in group, such as Users, Power Users, and
            Administrators

        NT AUTHORITY\
            Specifies an NT Authority group, such as Authenticated Users and
            INTERACTIVE

        DOMAINNAME\ or COMPUTERNAME\
            Specifies a domain or computer name

        If a group name contains spaces, remember to enclose it in quotes.

EXIT STATUS
    0
        Unsupported operating system, or the current user is not a member of
        any of the named groups.

    > 0
        Current user is a member of one or more groups. The exit code will
        correspond to the number of groups matched.

EXAMPLES
    1. ismember "MYDOMAIN\Domain Admins"
       if errorlevel 1 goto :DOMADM

       With these two lines in a shell script, it will branch to the label
       :DOMADM if the currently logged on user is a member of the group
       MYDOMAIN\Domain Admins.

    2. ismember LOCALPC\GroupName1 "MYDOMAIN\Special Group 2"
       if errorlevel 2 goto :BOTH
       if errorlevel 1 goto :ONE
       echo No match found

       The above example will branch to :BOTH if a user is a member of both
       groups. It will branch to :ONE if a user is a member of one of the two
       groups. To see which group(s) matched, use -v.

    3. ismember -l

       This displays output in the following format:

       BUILTIN\Administrators
       BUILTIN\Users
       Everyone
       LOCAL
       NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users
       NT AUTHORITY\INTERACTIVE
       6 groups(s) found
