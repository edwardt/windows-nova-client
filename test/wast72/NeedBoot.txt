SYNOPSIS
    needboot [-l | -q]

AVAILABILITY
    Win32 - Windows 95, 98, Me, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 2008, etc.

DESCRIPTION
    NeedBoot determines if a reboot is required by checking if the system is
    set to rename or delete files at the next boot.

    On the Windows 9x/Me platform, it checks for the existence of any entries
    in the [Rename] section of the WININIT.INI file in the Windows directory.
    If the [Rename] section exists and has one or more entries, NeedBoot will
    return 1.

    On the Windows NT platform, it checks for the existence of the
    PendingFileRenameOperations entry in the following registry key:

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Session Manager

    If this registry entry exists, NeedBoot will return 1.

PARAMETERS
    -l  List the entries in the [Rename] section of WININIT.INI (Win9x/Me) or
        the contents of the PendingFileRenameOperations registry entry (Windows
        NT 4.0 and later).

        On Windows 9x/Me, -l displays output as follows:

          [Rename] section of WININIT.INI contains:

          Key1=Value1
          ...

        On the Windows NT platform (Windows NT 4.0 and later), -l displays
        output as follows:

          PendingFileRenameOperations registry value contains:

          Source: <sourcefilename>
          Target: <targetfilename>
          ...

        The PendingFileRenameOperations registry value contains pairs of
        strings. The first string in the pair is the source filename, and the
        second string is the new name for the file. If the second string is
        empty, then the system will delete the file (the target filename will
        be displayed as "(DELETE)").

        If the PendingFileRenameOperations registry value exists but contains
        no data, NeedBoot will still report that a reboot is needed. This is an
        erroneous condition: Normally, the value should not exist but contain
        no data. You can safely delete it using a registry editor.

        On either platform, if -l says "(no data)", it will report that a
        reboot is not needed; otherwise, it will report that a reboot is
        needed.

    -q  Run quietly (suppress output). If you specify both -q and -l, -l takes
        precedence.

EXIT STATUS
    0   A reboot is not needed.
    1   A reboot is needed.
